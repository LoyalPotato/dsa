# Algorithms &amp; Data Structures

This is a compilation of Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in various languages.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute with a language that you know, you're more than welcome :)

Contributions to improve any explanation are welcomed as well!

Also if you have any implementation that is better in anyway than what is already there, then add it to a new file (Queue_v2 or something) with an explanation as to why it's better than the previous version/implementation.
